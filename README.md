# 🌐 Web Projects Playground

Welcome to the **Web Projects** repository! 👨‍💻✨

This is a curated collection of my hands-on experiments, UI explorations, and learning implementations using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Whether it's crafting interactive components, practicing layouts, or diving into browser APIs — it's all here!

---

## 🚀 What's in this Repo?

- 💡 Mini projects for **HTML5 semantics**, forms, and accessibility
- 🎨 CSS animations, flexbox/grid layouts, custom components, modern theming (dark/light)
- ⚙️ JavaScript logic including:
  - DOM manipulation & events
  - LocalStorage/sessionStorage
  - Fetch API basics
  - Form validation
  - Component toggles & state management
- 🎯 Responsive design & mobile-first styling
- 🔧 Practical mini-clones (e.g., calculators, to-do apps, image sliders)

> 💥 **Note:** This is a living, evolving space — projects are added as I explore new topics, tools, or challenges in frontend development.
